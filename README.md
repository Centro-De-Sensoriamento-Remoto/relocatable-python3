Introduction
============

This project builds a portable Python interpreter, along with all the shared libraries it depends on.
The build system itself is written in Python, based on zc.buildout and some recipes.

The sources are downloaded from the Internet, stored locally and then built.

The current supported platforms are: Linux, OS X, Windows, Solaris and AIX.

In order to build python, execute:

    pip install zc.buildout
    buildout bootstrap
    bin/buildout
    bin/build

**For Python 3.x, see [relocatable-python3](https://github.com/Infinidat/relocatable-python3)**
